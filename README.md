# DataSentics academy: Books task continued

In the [previous task](https://www.notion.so/datasentics/GDC-Academy-PySpark-final-task-75402ced1f8a45c0b2189de0b6259e69), you had to just get to the required answers in (almost) any way possible. Now you have to write a nice, more production-like code.

- Create and work in your own branch, derived from the `main` branch.
- You will submit your work by creating a pull request from your branch to `main`.
- The code that you push will be checked using the `flake8` linter according to rules in the `setup.cfg` file.
- You may push your work directly from Databricks Repos, but you may find it is better to use some local IDE like PyCharm or VSCode and git from local computer. To move code between databricks and local PC, you can use the Databricks CLI (doing it manually is a lot more work when you work with more than one file).
